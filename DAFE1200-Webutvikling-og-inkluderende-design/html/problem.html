        <p class="splitText2">Dyslexia is the most common learning difficulty among children. About 5% of the population has this disability,  that makes it hard for them translate what they read into words. Therefore they read slowly and often make mistakes. At the same time it is important to know that dyslexia has nothing to do with vision. And even though people with dyslexia have trouble reading, their intelligence is not affected. So they are not less intelligent than their peers. <br><br>

            <p>Children with dylexia can not outgrow it, but with the right approach and help their reading can improve. Anyhow dyslexia is different for everyone and it comes in different types and degrees. Someone have letters switching direction or places with other letters, while others see words floating over eachother.</p>

    <section class="text3">
        <p>We have chose the font "Dyslexie Font" for our app (amongst others) because it has slight changes in the letters that makes it less easy for people to mix up letters. People with dyslexia can mix d with b and p, m with w so the "Dyslexie Font" made these letters more different in form, and also increased the space between letters

            <h2>Our idea</h2>
            <p>The app Alexia can help dyslexic people to better read and understand texts they come across in their daily lives.
                This doesnt 'heal' dyslexia, but we hope it can make dyslexics lives better</p>
